Git notes:
In directory, run git init
git status shows you status of files to be committed
git add xxx where xxx if the file name
git status here will show you files that would be added.
git diff xxx will show you the differences in your current staged file and the working copy.

In summation:

git init

git status

git add

git diff

git commit

git log


Useful to know:

git show HEAD

git reset HEAD xxx <!-- where xxx is a previous commit SHA code, as shown in the git log step -->

Branching:

git branch 
(tells you what version you're working on)

git branch new_branch
(where new_branch is the new branch's name)

git checkout new_branch
(switch to the new branch)
